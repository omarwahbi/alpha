# Alpha website
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/iiAzrMnIIX0
#### Description: It's a website of a fictional marketing agency made with react.js and used Css and bootstrap for styling; I also did an admin panle for the website with its backend but i didn't find a free hosting service for the images so I only uploaded the website as a static site. 
Now I'm going to explain the files in the components folder
i made the project as a component based project meaning that there is a component for logos to show the client logo and a navbar component to be used on almost every page of the website and a cards components with some animations when they first show up i also made some animation on when the user hover on some texts to take them to another pages and made some carousel using bootstrap I also used firebase storage to store the clients logos and show them to users by first fetshing the logos using useffect then storing the result in a state usinf usestate hook of react and rendering the component to the user in the homepage 
I also used css media query to make the webapp looks the best on all mobile devices 


so it's a basic webapp that needs some improving hope you like it !
